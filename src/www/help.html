  Tiny-tools is composed of four pages:
  <a href='#browser'>Browser</a>,
  <a href='#editor'>Editor</a>,
  <a href='#shell'>Shell</a>,
  <a href='#upload'>Upload</a>.
</p>



<div>
  <a name='browser'>
  <h2>Browser</h2>

  <p>
    The Browser page allows navigating amongst directories.
  </p>

  <p>
    The current directory is shown at the top of the page. Navigating to a new
    directory will change the directory that is used for the Editor, Upload,
    and Shell pages.
  </p>

  <p>
    The files and directories in the current directory are shown.
    Clicking the '..' link will move to the parent directory. Clicking on a
    subdirectory name will change to that subdirectory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking the name of a file will display the contents of the file. If the
    file extension is '.htm' or '.html' the file will be displayed as HTML.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each file has an 'Edit' and a 'DL' link next to it. Clicking the 'Edit'
    link will open the file for editing on the Editor page. Clicking the 'DL'
    link will download the file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking 'Show Hidden' or 'Hide Hidden' toggles showing hidden files.
  </p>

</div>



<div>
  <a name='editor'>
  <h2>Editor</h2>

  <p>
    The Editor page allows editing text files.
  </p>

  <p>
    Entering the absolute path to a filename in the textbox and then clicking
    'Open' will display the file contents in the textarea. If the filename
    has no path component (i.e. it does not contain a '/') the filename will be
    appended to the current directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the Editor is opened from the Browser page the name of the text file
    will be shown in the textbox and the contents of the file will be shown
    in the textarea.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking the 'Save' button will write the contents of the textarea to the
    filename specified in the textbox. If the path or filename in the textbox
    is modified, the contents of the textarea will be written to the new,
    modified name; all directories in the path must already exist.
  </p>

  <p>
     When saving, the original file is deleted and then re-written. If an
     unexpected error occurs the file might not be fully re-written. For
     maximum safety to avoid data loss, either specify a new name to save to
     or use the Shell page to make a back-up of the file before editing.
  <p>

  </p>
    In some environments, after clicking 'Save', the request that the browser
    sends to the server will never complete and the browser will continuously
    'spin' as it waits for a reply that will never come. If this happens,
    stop/cancel the request. This will cause the the submitted data to be
    saved. Editing can then proceed, as normal.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 'Assist' button exists for browsers that do not accept keys like Enter
    or Tab. In many browsers, pressing Tab moves the focus to the next form
    field rather than inserting a Tab character. Clicking the 'Assist' button
    will toggle the display of the assist-controls. The assist-controls provide
    crude cursor-control and the ability to insert any character into the text
    area.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking '&lt;&lt;' will cause the cursor to move backward N characters.
    Clicking '&gt;&gt;' will cause the cursor to move forward N characters.
    The value of N is specified in the textbox separating the two buttons.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 'Enter', 'Tab', and 'Any' buttons can be used to insert an Enter
    character, a Tab character, or any character (respectively), into the
    textarea. The Enter and Tab buttons have a text box to the left of them.
    When the 'Enter' button is clicked, whatever string is in its textbox will
    be searched for the textarea. Each time the string is found, it will be
    replaced with a newline character.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 'Tab' button works in a similar manner. When the 'Tab' button is clicked,
    whatever string is in its textbox will be searched for in the textarea. Each
    time the string is found, it will be replaced with the tab character.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 'Any' button allows any character to be inserted into the textarea. The
    'Any' button has two text boxes to the left of it. The left textbox
    specifies the string to search for. The right textbox specifies the ASCII
    code (1-255) which will replace the string. The 'Any' button can also be
    used to insert an Enter character or a Tab character. The 'Enter' and 'Tab'
    buttons exist only for convenience.
  </p>

</div>


<div>
  <a name='shell'>
  <h2>Shell</h2>

  <p>
    The Shell page allows simple commands to be executed, as if they were
    entered in a real terminal.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Only execute commands that will complete without needing
    any other input from the user. Programs such as 'top' and 'vi' should not
    be run unless they are run in such a way that they terminate without
    additional user input. E.g., '<tt>top -n 1</tt>' or
    '<tt>printf "iHello World!\x1b:wq\n" | vi hw.txt</tt>'.
  </p>

  <p>
    The current directory is shown at the top of the page. To change to a new
    directory, type 'cd' followed by exactly one space, followed by the new
    directory name. (Or navigate to a new directory on the Browser page.)
    Changing to a new directory will change the directory that is used for the
    Editor, Browser, and Upload pages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below the directory is a text box where commands may be entered. The
    results of the command will be shown in the area below the text box. (When
    running under ShServer, any errors from the command may appear above the
    header.)
  </p>

  <p>
    There are three methods for executing (submitting) whatever is entered in
    the text box:
    <ul>
      <li>Press Enter.</li>
      <li>Click the Run button.</li>
      <li>Type three consecutive spaces after the command. This method is
      supported for browsers where the Enter key is ignored.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Each submitted command line is run in a new shell so any variable or alias
    that is set will not be retained between submissions. If needed, they
    can be set in a script (on the server) which is run prior to the commands
    that need them. (e.g. '<tt>set_vars.sh; cmd1; cmd2</tt>')
  </p>

  <p>
    The Shell does not provide any command history, however many browsers will
    display entries that were previously typed into the text box.
  </p>

</div>




<div>
  <a name='upload'>
  <h2>Upload</h2>

  <p>
    The Upload page enables uploading a file to the remote computer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The current directory of the remote computer is displayed at the top of the
    page. Uploaded files will be saved into this directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Directly below the display of the current directory is a button. The label
    on the button depends on what browser is being used. Clicking the button
    allows selecting a file on the local computer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking the 'Upload' button will upload the selected file to the remote
    computer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The uploaded file MUST be a textual file. This means the file must be plain
    text, uuencoded, base64-encoded, or some other text-encoding such as
    hex-encoded or oct-encoded. Uploading a binary file will fail.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the uploaded file is not plain text and has been text-encoded (base64,
    uuencoded, hex, oct), it will be automatically decoded after it is
    uploaded. To prevent decoding the file, uncheck the 'Decode' button.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the uploaded file has an extension, the decoded file will not have the
    extension. If the uploaded file does not have an extension, the decoded
    file will have '.out' appended to it. In either case, the decoded file will
    overwrite any file with the same name.
  </p>

  <p>
    For decoding uuencoded or base64-encoded files, the appropriate program for
    decoding (uudecode or base64, respectively) must exist on the remote
    computer. No external programs are needed for decoding hex-encoded or
    oct-encoded files.
  </p>
